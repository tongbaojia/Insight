      "that they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don't break \n",

      "there.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \n",
      "already started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \n",
      "family there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \n",
      "don't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \n",
      "husband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \n",
      "There was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \n",
      "were going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \n",
      "wasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\n",
      "the Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \n",
      "beat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \n",

      "television, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \n",
      "us why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \n",

      "\n",
      "At the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \n",
      "and so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \n",
      "off a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \n",
      "there, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \n",
      "first I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \n",
      "\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \n",
      "don't know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \n",
      "it, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \n",
      "he didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \n",
      "her. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \n",
      "down, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \n",
      "balconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \n",
      "blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \n",
      "from here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\n",
      "of course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\n",
      "I also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\n",
      "that woman, because I had just seen that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \n",

      "defended us, they said, \"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \n",

      "\n",
      "But at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \n",
      "came back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \n",
      "upset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \n",
      "balcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \n",
      "though it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \n",
      "and I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \n",
      "and the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \n",
      "time they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \n",
      "morning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \n",
      "Azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \n",
      "too. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\n",
      "garbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \n",
      "toward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \n",
      "could see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \n",
      "Azerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \n",

      "same apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\n",
      "through--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\n",
      "his mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\n",

      ". . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\" His \n",

      "I am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \n",
      "just have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\n",
      "parents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \n",
      "superficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \n",
      "everywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \n",
      "apartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \n",
      "the windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \n",
      "in that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \n",
      "Vitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \n",
      "been murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \n",
      "ago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \n",
      "left Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \n",
      "Yerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \n",
      "straight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\n",
      "been killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\n",
      "his classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \n",
      "them, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \n",
      "a coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \n",
      "kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \n",
      "there in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \n",

      "Now . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\n",
      "well, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\n",
      "some six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\n",
      "of people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\n",
      "point when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\n",
      "so much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\n",
      "around Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\n",
      "with bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \n",
      "don't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \n",
      "I arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \n",
      "not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \n",
      "were guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \n",
      "single person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \n",
      "all the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \n",
      "anyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\n",
      "could have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\n",
      "know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \n",
      "guilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\n",
      "Azerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\n",
      "only perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \n",
      "seems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \n",
      "you know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \n",
      "people, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \n",
      "Armenian?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\n",
      "not become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\n",
      "the time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\n",
      "When I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \n",
      "couldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\n",
      "mentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \n",
      "did you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \n",
      "these women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \n",
      "tremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\n",
      "already sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \n",
      "cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \n",
      "the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \n",
      "it everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \n",
      "were never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\n",
      "to do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\n",
      "that Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \n",
      "was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \n",
      "personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \n",
      "advised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \n",
      "tried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\n",
      "Committee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\n",
      "hand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\n",
      "I told him, \"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \n",
      "what you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \n",
      "traces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \n",
      "yes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \n",
      "very funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \n",
      "expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \n",
      "did you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\n",
      "you're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\n",
      "to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\n",
      "already getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\n",
      "them?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \n",
      "he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \n",
      "and hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \n",
      "didn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \n",
      "Muslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\n",
      "guilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \n",
      "us an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \n",
      "raping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \n",
      "carrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \n",
      "then?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \n",
      "anticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \n",
      "laughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \n",
      "know what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \n",
      "you: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \n",
      "front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \n",
      "over his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \n",
      "during the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\n",
      "either he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \n",
      "away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \n",
      "excuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \n",
      "you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \n",
      "That's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \n",
      "party committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \n",
      "they all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \n",
      "impunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \n",
      "days, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \n",
      "have finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \n",
      "Russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \n",
      "them, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\n",
      "the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\n",
      "arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\n",
      "the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \n",
      "asked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \n",
      "us the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\n",
      "stay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \n",
      "General Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \n",
      "cities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \n",
      "the affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\n",
      "as everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \n",
      "he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \n",
      "by the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \n",
      "because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \n",
      "and he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\n",
      "horrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \n",
      "punished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \n",
      "throws herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n",
      "\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \n",
      "to calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \n",
